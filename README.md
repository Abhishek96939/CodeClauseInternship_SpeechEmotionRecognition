# CodeClauseInternship_SpeechEmotionRecognition

This Python script appears to be a machine learning project for audio-based emotion classification. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Imports necessary libraries:** The script imports various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, librosa for audio analysis, and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training neural networks.

2. **Loads audio data:** It collects a list of audio file paths and their corresponding emotion labels from a specified directory (e.g., '/kaggle/input/TESS Toronto emotional speech set data').

3. **Data Preprocessing:** The script preprocesses the audio data by extracting features from each audio file. It calculates the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for each audio file using the librosa library.

4. **Data Visualization:** The code then visualizes the waveform and spectrogram for a subset of audio files, categorizing them by emotion (e.g., angry, sad, happy). This visualization helps understand the characteristics of the audio data.

5. **Model Building:** It defines a neural network model using Keras. The model consists of LSTM layers with dropout and dense layers, followed by softmax activation for multiclass classification. The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

6. **Model Training:** The script trains the neural network using the preprocessed audio features (MFCCs) and corresponding emotion labels. Training progress, including training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss, is visualized with line graphs.

7. **Model Saving:** The trained model is saved to a file named 'my_model.h5'.

8. **Model Loading:** The script demonstrates how to load the saved model from the 'my_model.h5' file.

9. **Audio Prediction:** It defines functions to preprocess audio files, make predictions about the emotion conveyed in the audio, and display the predicted emotion label along with the waveform and spectrogram of the input audio.

10. **User Interaction:** The script allows users to input a local audio file path for emotion prediction. It displays the predicted emotion label, plays the audio, and shows the waveform and spectrogram of the audio.

Note: The script assumes that the audio files are organized in a specific directory structure and that a pre-trained model named 'my_model.h5' is available for loading. Additionally, it uses the TESS Toronto emotional speech set data for this demonstration. You may need to adapt the code to your specific dataset and file paths.
